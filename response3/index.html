			<li> a shop is a building or part of a building where goods or services are sold; a store.
			shop served as a box to contain things for the longest times, but these days, people oftentimes would
			just go to a shop/store for its aesthetic interiors or should i say photogenic, author is comparing website 
			to all these art galleries and it really got me thinking that maybe one day people are gonna start visiting 
			websites as of they are going to an exhibition. i mean i personally still like the physical interaction with 
			just things and objects in general but i think itd be pretty litt if we will be able to try on clothes via online shopping
			thru like a VR program or something.</li>

				<li>"The design of an artists website contextualises production. 
				Just as the white cube (optional: polished concrete floors, skylights) 
				is a recognisable, sanctioned structure for viewing contemporary art, 
				so the list of links on the left or the grid of thumbnail images have 
				come to define the artists website. <mark>In both cases, the visitor discerns 
				that this is a space for contemporary art; in both, the architecture defines 
				the viewing experience.</mark> Just as paintings look great against white walls with
				 overhead lights, so a series of thumbnails communicates a certain brand of 
				 visual art, which is objectoriented and emphasises cohesion, since viewing 
				 the grid of thumbnail images or cropped details delivers consistency of vision."<br></br><br>
				 they are both a space but i wonder how are we supposed to make website as engaging as of 
				 we are physically being in a space because i personally would choose to go to a nice little exhibition than sitting in front 
				 of my desk viewing websites on a sunday afternoon anytime.</li>
