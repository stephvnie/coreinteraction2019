<p1>I am stephanie welcome to my web. Born & made in China. As of 2019, I am a 20 year old <span>Libra</span>. I like to read books (in Chinese tho) never in English I am not sure why. I would say that I always like to come off as a friendly, bright & cheerful person maybe a lil funny, very promising for sure. The most first impression I get from people is that I have the biggest resting-bitch-face and scared to reach me, pretty much frightful.
</p1>

<p2>My name is Chuhan, I am studying in New York, US. My brother graduated last year and is now working in San Francisco. Yes, I will eventually going to come back and settle down in China. New York is such a big city, very hectic & busy vibe. But I like it, I am <span>used to</span> it more than Shenzhen.
</p2>

<p3>I am optimistic. I am very ambitious towards my work. My parent is my biggest <span>motivation</span>. I am grateful for having such a fulfilling and happy life. I have pretty much done nothing to have the opportunity to live and study in New York City. I love my major, I am glad that I didn’t get into Steven’s college and be where I am at today. Could have never imagined how I would survive Boston University and learning about hotel management. I can't let anyone down I gotta keep it up.
</p3>

<p4>I am fine, I am happy, I am living life. Don’t worry about me. School is hard but I got this. No, I don’t struggle in school. No, I don’t need a boyfriend. Everything is under my control. I study hard I play hard too. I do go to bed late but you see I can still manage to wake up early, and yes I know it's very important to eat breakfast before chugging down my cold brew. I do eat my breakfast nowwwww. My friends are not weird, you do know I go to an art school right. Stop being such narrow-minded. Please dad it's brick in NY, I think I need a new jacket, like forreal, you don’t wanna see your <span>daughter</span> turn into Olaf ;)
</p4>

<p5>Hi I am Stephanie. Call me <span>chuchu train</span> if you want, that's a nickname given by my high school friends. I go to Parsons in the city. It’s an art school. LOL it's cool, it's chill. Nah, we don’t get tests, we get big projects when y’all be having finals. For you it’s mostly about memorization, for us that can’t do shit we have to be creative ALL THE TIME and lemme tell you when you don’t get inspirations, you are pretty much failing. OMG I love your shirt where did you get it?

</p5>

<p6>I never thought a single moment in my life was painful until I met you. The pain before was suffocating to me. Today is more so relieved. I miss you, I can’t let it go but I know for sure though I will never wanna go back to you. I gave back all your stuff, but I can’t return our memories. I have to stop looking back and look forward & move on only. I have to enrich myself, I have to <span>become stronger</span>. I don’t need anyone’s charity or pity or anything. People say men are women’s forever haven. I wanna be my own umbrella. I hate myself for being sensitive, for being emotional, for being stubborn, for being so gullible, for being naïve. And believe in that bad people only exist on TV shows but I still wanna be a good person.
</p6>

<p7>I am stephanie Lin. A current BFA student at Parsons School of Design majoring in <span>Communication Design</span>. Fluent in English Mandarin and Cantonese. I am skilled in Adobe photoshop illustrator indesign and premiere-pro. 	
</p7>

<p8>I am fragile. I am broken. I don’t deserve any of this shit. I have to make it up to my parents. I have to keep grinding. I have come this far but I wanna give up. I <span>can’t take this anymore</span>. I miss my family. I miss being treated like a princess every time I go back to China. I miss being surrounded with my family and amazing food. What’s the point of this bullshit. Why did I choose to stay away from all of that just to suffer more. I wanna just drop everything here and lay on my butt and do nothing for the rest of my life. I am just tired…
</p8>

<p9>I am very honest with my friends, I have absolutely zero filter. I always like to reminisce about my childhood. I am loving and caring towards my family. And that is where I learned my tough love from. i get mad fast but also get over it fast. I am tough on the outside, sensitive on the inside, seems like I have got one of the worse tempers and <span>has no patience</span>, but I actually cares a lot and will always be down to listen no matter how many times my friends complain about her life ^ S/O to tiffany. They say that I have a small body but a big heart but I get mad when my friends spill crumbs on my carpet.
