			I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to make a correlation between handmade web
			pages and handmade print materials, such as zines, pamphlets, and artists books.
			i agree with this because since webs are not physical copies we cant physically own
			them yet at the same time we can keep them forever and present them to anyone no matter
			where they are.

			id totally disagree with author if i didnt know anything about coding, why would
			anyone ever choose to make websites from scatch when there are so many softwares we 
			can use as tools to make our own, but that was also because i only knew website as a
			tool/functional archive webs... but after learning a lot of it, there are so much more we
			can do while coding our own web, it opens a new door for me. btw reading this article drives me
			nuts cuz they emphasis on the tittles.
