			<li><i>"when you put energy into a website, in turn the website helps form your own identity."</i>
			<div>In what ways does a website help to form your own identity?</div>
			as of now, i see making website/coding as a different language/tool/medium/platform for me to explore and maybe it would help me to think
			from a different perspective when it comes to designing, because its taking a total different&extra route to get to my final thoughts. before turning 
			my ideas to live, i have to convert them into codes and type them up one by one, layer by layer, i guess i can still find similarities but overall
			it does give me a brand new experience than just drawing&sketching on my sketchbook and executing them on indesign.</li>
			<li>should we be developing our own unique styles in our websites and how?</li>
