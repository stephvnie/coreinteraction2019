		We no longer have any desire for design that is driven by need.
		i think we still do buy things we need, but obviously i am always
		more driven when i see things with fun design or design that suits my
		taste/style. i mean i have never lived in an era where ppl had desire to
		buy things are needed but it is very hard for me to imagine that.
		deisgn is added value, but i think demand for better deisign is increasing as well.

		designers are ambitious thats how they make new work, so are human, we are all ambitious in 
		ways thats why we are constantly asking/looking for new designs tho the funtion might be the 
		same. i think to get better in design, we first have to acknowledge what we desire and so we can apply
		that onto our design. also that is literally the reason why my parents agreed to me studying comm design
		because the world is progressing so is their perspective towards going to an art school.
