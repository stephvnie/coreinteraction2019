		<h1>exercise 1: project page</h1>
		
		<p>for this project, I had to design a set of my own <b>typographic dictionary</b> with both 
		<a href="https://www.fonts.com/content/learning/fontology/glossary"><i>definition</i></a> and <a href="https://www.fontshop.com/glossary"><i>visual interpretation</i></a>, as well as a box or device to hold my cards together.</p>
		
		<p><div><img src="1.jpg" height="300px" width="500px"></div>4x6" vocabulary cards</p>
		<img src="2.jpg" width="360px" height="500px">
		<img src="3.jpg" width="360px" height="500px">
		<div>a box designed and made by me for the cards, by deconstructing my empty pack and altering sizes of each part...</div>
