			after reading the first paragraph got me asking myself the same question, why choose graphic design, a career path that doesnt get enough credit/respect? from people. I actually always wanted to be the person behind one who gets all the attention/credit, lmfao I wonder if I chose this unconciously cuz its the same with graphic design. v intersting.

		“Work must be saying something, which is different than being about something.” I think it really depends, lets just say for a Avengers: Endgame movie poster, its about the movie but also it could be informative given cast list and show time which is saying something I think its really about the balance between both.
