		<p>What Happens When You Create A Flexbox Flex Container?<br>
			
            Use display: flex; to create a flex container and make sure there is an element to be used.<br>
            Use flex-direction if you need columns instead of rows, to set the direction of the main axis.<br>
            Use the row-reverse or column-reverse values to flip item order, <br>
            allow them to lay themselves out one after the other ending up in reverse order.<br>
            Use justify-content to define the horizontal alignment of items.<br>
            Use align-items to define the vertical alignment of items.<br>
            Use the row-reverse or column-reverse values to flip item order, <br>
            allow them to lay themselves out one after the other ending up in reverse order.<br>

        <p>What We Mean When We Say “responsive”<br>
            
            Responsive web design is an approach whereby a designer creates a web page that <br>
            “responds to” or resizes itself depending on the type of device it is being seen through.<br>
            it is a way of developing website through different properties so that the device on determines<br> 
            the way that the site will be displayed. so when the screen is being resized the website gives out certain<br>
            responses to suit the window/screen better.
