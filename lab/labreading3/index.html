		<h1>reading 3</h1>
		describe why each writer thinks collecting is important. 
		(3 sentences each)
		did these readings give you ideas on what you will collect or 
		have already collected? if so, what were they?
		<p>Ordinary plenty<br>collecting is important because that is the only way to make sure that we ourselves have
		permanant control over it.<br>collecting is necessary but should never trust a third party on taking the responsibility for you.<br>
	people can never indicate what happens in the future so its good that we have a collection of everything online.</p>

		<p>Rutherford Chang on the art of collection<br>collector loves the fact that they are collecting limited editions that yet at the same time they will never be 
			able to collect them all. <br>he views each individual object as unique in its own way but were once-identical.<br>
		over times, since the world is always evolving and changing the way you view things would change too its just a good way to 
		keep records.

		<p>Kameelah Janan Rasheed on research and archiving<br>she studies the role of archives historically and how they gathered information for the purpose of controlling people..<br>
		in her case, she uses found archives to help her study on certain things, it is not just about collecting she does research based on 
	others collection, and then at the end she will come up with her own collection of researches.</p>
