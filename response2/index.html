		<p>
		<ul>
		<li>ive always wondered how much knowledge that i am learning right now
		can actually be useful to me when i eventually have to go back to china 
		and work.. since i have been here at such a young age, although i do speak 
		and use chinese but comparing it to english it is a total different language, 
		french and english are at least all made up by letter from my understanding but 
		chinese and english lol the only common i see in them is that they are both a language.
		
		</li><li>in what way am i supposed to get inspirations from this reading for my exercise2 tho?
		</li>
		</ul></p>
