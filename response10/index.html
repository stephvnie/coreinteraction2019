"...fonts were perceived as tools..." Author mentioned before technology came into the picture fonts were used as a tool, and I have learned that typeface is important and is being used depends what content and topic it is. I wonder how would my thinking/designing process would change if I were to do it the "old fashion" way.

since now everything is digitalized and computerized, people often taken typefaces for granted including myself but at the same time what used to be so time-consuming has shrunk exponentially I guess, instead we focus on legibility and interaction more and more which are things that wouldve been v hard to acheived with traditional methods.
