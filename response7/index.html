		<p>i see memes as funny, relatable however its nothing but comedic relief, yes maybe by looking at a series of memes from a period of time can kind of summerize/analyze what was
			popping at the time, but memes come and go fast. people dont take it seriously. not to mention memes are almost only popular for teens and young adults.<p>
		<p>idk why and how did they even make that connections between memes and these researchs they are doing. memes are funny and they come and go, they are not that big of a deal, not to mention to link it with some political beliefs.</p>
