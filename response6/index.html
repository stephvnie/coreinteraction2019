		<p>
			though i have never worked with/learned anything about UI, as i am reading
			i find a lot of things and elements that i am somewhat familiar with, maybe
			things i have learned from classes, or just rules that i follow subconciously
			while designing posters, booklets, etc. i enjoyed this website, because it gives 
			an outline of the process of design, and even about typography, which i think is 
			also considered part of design. i wonder how much of a difference it is between 
			graphic deisng and UI, since i have only dealt with deisign that does not require
			any interaction or usability.
		</p>
		<p>
			i have heard of UX, but not UI, UX is creating or deisgning things based on user 
			experience or provide a better user experience through integrating deign. and UI
			is part of it..? with UI, it requires more since it has to be suitable on different
			devices.. everything on the website i seem to understand but i still think its so much 
			harder to execute.
